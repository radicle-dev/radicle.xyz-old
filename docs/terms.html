          <p>These Terms of Use govern access to and use of the Radicle Network. The Radicle Network enables Users to manage software projects and to host, develop, and review software code in a collaborative manner.</p>
          <p>The Radicle Network is a fully decentralized and autonomous ecosystem with an opt-in Ethereum protocol integration. There is no single third party solely involved in or in any way responsible for the operation, running or functioning of the Radicle Network and/or any of the interactions, collaborations or (contractual) relationships among Users on the Radicle Network.</p>
          <p>The underlying software protocols of the Radicle Network (the “<u>Software</u>”) have been developed and published under the GPLv3+Linking Exception license, which forms an integral part of these Terms and Conditions.
