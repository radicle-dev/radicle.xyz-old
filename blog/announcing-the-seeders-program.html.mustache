        <h3>
         Today, we're announcing the launch of Radicle's Seeders Program. The Seeders Program is supporting the progressive decentralization of the Radicle network among its community by cultivating a strong "root network" of individuals and projects who are committed to supporting the long-term vision of the project. Current participants include individuals from <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>, <a href="https://synthetix.io/">Synthetix</a>, <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>, <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/">Gnosis Safe</a>, <a href="https://thegraph.com/">The Graph</a>, <a href="https://gitcoin.co">Gitcoin</a>, <a href="https://dxdao.eth.link/#/">dxDAO</a>, <a href="https://optimism.io/">Optimism</a>, the <a href="https://interchain.io/">Interchain Foundation</a>, <a href="https://dorg.tech/">dOrg</a>, <a hef="https://www.curvelabs.eu/">Curve Labs</a>, <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic Network</a>,  <a href="https://informal.systems/">Informal Systems</a>, <a href="https://vega.xyz/">Vega Protocol</a>, the <a href="https://celo.org/">Celo Foundation</a>, <a href="https://fleek.co">Fleek</a>, <a href="https://status.im/">Status</a>, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the <a href="https://web3.foundation/">Web3 Foundation</a>, and more.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The resilience and success of a cryptonetwork are reliant on the community that cultivates and stewards it. The goal of the Seeder Program is to bootstrap a healthy, enriched, and active community of individuals to tend, cultivate, and refine the governance of the Radicle network.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Seeders Program will have multiple phases, each further decentralizing the network while supporting the development of healthy and sustainable governance processes.

        <p>
          Participants from this phase (Sprouting) include Radicle's earliest users and contributors, as well as a number of projects and individuals within the Web3 ecosystem who are interested in contributing the development of the Radicle project.

          Seeders participating in the Sprouting phase have received the network's <a href="https://radicle.xyz/blog/introducing-rad.html">first community distribution</a>, establishing them as the first members of the Radicle network beyond the project's early supporters and core team. Many have already announced themselves as delegates on <a href="https://gov.radicle.network/#/">gov.radicle.network</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>What comes next?</h2>
        <p>
          Over the coming weeks, our Seeders will be contributing to the development and governance of the Radicle network. We'll be sharing exciting contributions as they come!
        </p>
        <p>
          The upcoming phases of the Seeder Program will create the space for the development of sustainable governance processes and best practices. Participants will kickstart the "fruiting" of the network by co-designing proposals for community initatives and Treasury distributions. These initial "fruits" (i.e. governance proposals) will support the healthy ripening of the network by creating value flows that will support the long-term sustainability of the network. <strong>There will be opportunities for wider community participation throughout future phases of the Seeder Program, so stay tuned!</strong>.
