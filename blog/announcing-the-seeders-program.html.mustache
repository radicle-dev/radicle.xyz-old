        <h3>
         Today, we're announcing the launch of Radicle's Seeder Program. The Seeder Program is supporting the progressive decentralization of the Radicle network by cultivating a strong "root network" of individuals and projects who are committed to supporting the long-term resilience and growth of the Radicle network. Current participants include individuals from <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>, <a href="https://synthetix.io/">Synthetix</a>, <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>, <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/">Gnosis Safe</a>, <a href="https://thegraph.com/">The Graph</a>, <a href="https://gitcoin.co">Gitcoin</a>, <a href="https://dxdao.eth.link/#/">dxDAO</a>, <a href="https://optimism.io/">Optimism</a>, the <a href="https://interchain.io/">Interchain Foundation</a>, <a href="https://dorg.tech/">dOrg</a>, <a hef="https://www.curvelabs.eu/">Curve Labs</a>, <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic Network</a>,  <a href="https://informal.systems/">Informal Systems</a>, <a href="https://vega.xyz/">Vega Protocol</a>, the <a href="https://celo.org/">Celo Foundation</a>, <a href="https://fleek.co">Fleek</a>, <a href="https://status.im/">Status</a>, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the <a href="https://web3.foundation/">Web3 Foundation</a>, and more.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The resilience and success of a cryptonetwork are reliant on the community that cultivates and stewards it. Therefore, the purpose of the Seeder Program is to cultivate a healthy, enriched, and active governing community to support the long-term sustainability of the Radicle network.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Seeder Program will have multiple phases, each one cultivating the needs of the existing community while supporting its growth.

        <p>
          This phase (Sprouting) brought together our first group of Seeders made up of Radicle's earliest users and contributors, as well as a number of projects and individuals within the Web3 ecosystem who are interested in contributing the development of the Radicle project. You may follow some of them on twitter...

          Seeders participating in the Sprouting phase have received the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/blog/introducing-rad.html">first community distribution</a>, establishing them as the first members of the Radicle network beyond the project's early supporters and core team. Many have already announced themselves as delegates on <a href="https://gov.radicle.network/#/">gov.radicle.network</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>What comes next?</h2>
        <p>
          Over the coming weeks, our Seeders will be contributing to development and governance of the Radicle network. We'll be sharing exciting contributions as they come!
        </p>
        <p>
          The next phases of the Seeder Program will support the transition of the network to member-based economics and governance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>There will be opportunities for wider community participation throughout future phases of the Seeder Program, so stay tuned!</strong>.
