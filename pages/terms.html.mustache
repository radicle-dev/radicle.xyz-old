          <li id="i"><h3>Introduction</h3></li>
          <p>These Terms of Use govern access to and use of the Radicle Network. The Radicle Network enables Users to manage software projects and to host, develop, and review software code in a collaborative manner.</p>
          <p>The Radicle Network is a fully decentralized and autonomous ecosystem with an opt-in Ethereum protocol integration. There is no single third party solely involved in or in any way responsible for the operation, running or functioning of the Radicle Network and/or any of the interactions, collaborations or (contractual) relationships among Users on the Radicle Network.</p>
          <p>The underlying software protocols of the Radicle Network (the “<u>Software</u>”) have been developed and published under the GPLv3+Linking Exception license, which forms an integral part of these Terms and Conditions. The full license strategy of Radicle Network can be viewed here: <a href="https://radicle.community/t/radicle-licensing-model/">https://radicle.community/t/radicle-licensing-model/282</a>.</p>
          <p>As the Radicle Network (and in particular, the Software) is of experimental nature, You acknowledge that the Radicle Network is likely to contain bugs, defects, or errors (including any bug, defect, or error relating to or resulting from the display, manipulation, processing, storage, transmission, or use of data) that may materially and adversely affects the use, functionality, or performance of the Radicle Network or any product or system containing or used in conjunction with the Radicle Network.</p>
          <p>Part of the Radicle Network’s feature set is a dedicated Ethereum-based transaction system, which enables Users to transfer DAI / ETH and/or the Radicle Network’s native tokens (“<u>Radicle Tokens”</u>) to the Radicle Network to access some core functionalities of the Radicle Network. Transfers of DAI / ETH and/ or Radicle Tokens to the Radicle Network require ETH as gas.</p>
          <p>THE RADICLE NETWORK AND THE SOFTWARE ARE HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND ANY REAL ETH, DAI, OR RAD SENT TO POTENTIALLY INSECURE SOFTWARE THAT REMAINS UNDER DEVELOPMENT ARE AT RISK OF BEING LOST INDEFINITELY, WITHOUT ANY KIND OF CONSIDERATION.</p>

          <li id="ii"><h3>Content / Loss of Content</h3></li>

You acknowledge and accept that there is no party making any representations or warranties with respect to any such Content and no party has assumed any liability as to such Content.</p>
          <p>You are aware and acknowledge that your processing, development, exchange, storage sharing, provision of, contribution to or other involvement in Content on or via the Radicle Network takes place in an experimental environment. You acknowledge and agree that You have no claim as to the integrity and consistency of any Content.
