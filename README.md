## Build

Build with the `make` command.

Building requires `mustache`, which you can install with `make dependencies` or
`npm install -g mustache`.

Each file in `pages/` results in an output `.html` in `docs/`.
The `partials/` folder includes things like headers, footers etc.

Never edit `.html` files in `docs/`.
